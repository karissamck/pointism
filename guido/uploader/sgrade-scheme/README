diffs to disarm.ss

- removed the following from safe-from-scheme list because these
  are defined in Byron's file system abstraction:
        display
        eof-object?
        read
        read-char
        write
        write-char
        open-input-file
        open-output-file

- changed behavior on a load to be silent rather than issuing a warning

- no warning on extra-scheme-exports
